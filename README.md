# Train-and-test-Data-Splitter

I wrote this program to split the data randomly of a txt Datafile into 2 different files, which I used for my Machine Learning programs as Training File and Testing file.

1) Have a text file ready which you need to split.
2) Get the path name and file names as per your choice. Update the py file (which is pretty intuitive).
3) Run the program

Have fun !!
